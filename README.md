# audaio
A compilation of libraries, case studies, resources, datasets, and research papers revolving around deep learning/machine learning for audio

## Libraries
- [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech): an open source embedded (offline, on-device) speech-to-text engine which can run in real time on devices ranging from a Raspberry Pi 4 to high power GPU servers.
- [PaddleSpeech](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSpeech): Easy-to-use Speech Toolkit including SOTA/Streaming ASR with punctuation, influential TTS with text frontend, Speaker Verification System, End-to-End Speech Translation and Keyword Spotting.
