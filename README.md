# audaio
A practical compilation of libraries, case studies, resources, datasets, and research papers revolving around deep learning/machine learning for audio. ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶
Reasonable resources you will actually use!

## Audio ML Landscape Map
- I will add this very soon!

## Datasets
- [FMA: A Dataset For Music Analysis](https://github.com/mdeff/fma)
- 


## Libraries
### End-to-end Toolkits
- [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech): an open source embedded (offline, on-device) speech-to-text engine which can run in real time on devices ranging from a Raspberry Pi 4 to high power GPU servers.
- [PaddleSpeech](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSpeech): Easy-to-use Speech Toolkit including SOTA/Streaming ASR with punctuation, influential TTS with text frontend, Speaker Verification System, End-to-End Speech Translation and Keyword Spotting.
- [NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo): a toolkit for conversaional AI
### Data Transformation and Manipulation
- [torchaudio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio): Data manipulation and transformation for audio signal processing, powered by PyTorch
- [nlpaug](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug): Data augmentation for NLP. This has spectrogram and audio input support. Check [this](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug/blob/master/example/spectrogram_augmenter.ipynb) and [this](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug/blob/master/example/audio_augmenter.ipynb)
- [pedalboard](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard): A Python library for working with audio. Internally at Spotify, pedalboard is used for data augmentation to improve machine learning models. pedalboard also helps in the process of content creation, making it possible to add effects to audio without using a Digital Audio Workstation.
